## Description
The website is a basic search engine that allows the users to search three different web API's, giving them information on local restaurants, local breweries, and Cocktail recipes. When searching for either a restaurant or a brewery all you need to do is plug in the zipcode that you would like to search in the proved search bar, this will then populate the search results area with the information that is pulled from the API for the specific zip code. The website also saves your past searches so that you can easily search them again, it does this by saving the searched zip code to local storage, once in local storage the value that was searched is saved to a button on the page. The Cocktails portion of this website functions similarly but you can either search by name or important ingredient. This also uses the same local storage function that the other searches use.
